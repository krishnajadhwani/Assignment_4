    "The four pillars of object-oriented programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit, which is the class.\n",
    "The class acts as a protective container that hides the internal implementation details of the object from the outside world.\n",
    "Access to the data and methods is typically provided through public, private, and protected access modifiers, controlling the visibility and accessibility of these members.\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex real-world entities into their essential characteristics, representing only the relevant features while hiding unnecessary details.\n",
    "It allows you to create abstract classes or interfaces that define the structure and behavior of objects without specifying the implementation.\n",
    "Abstraction enables developers to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it, promoting a high level of modularity and reducing code complexity.\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (the subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (the superclass or base class).\n",
    "The subclass can extend and specialize the functionality of the superclass, inheriting its attributes and methods while adding new ones or overriding existing ones.\n",
    "This facilitates code reuse, as common characteristics can be defined in a base class and shared across multiple subclasses, reducing redundant code.\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism means the ability of a class or method to take on multiple forms.\n",
    "There are two types of polymorphism in OOP: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).\n",
    "Method overloading allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name but different parameters, and the appropriate method is selected based on the number or type of arguments during compile-time.\n",
    "Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass, allowing objects of different classes to be treated uniformly through a common interface.\n",
    "These four pillars together form the foundation of object-oriented programming and are essential for creating flexible, modular, and maintainable software systems.\n"
